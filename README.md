# Second Milestone Project – Travel Application

## Pitch

The app routeRep will promote an emphasis on travelling in a way that is cost-effective, time-sensitive and most importantly environmentally friendly. Based on user input, it will provide users with a journey plan informed by these considerations.   
In addition, it will provide recommendations for accommodation, restaurants and tourist attractions. In keeping with the environmental theme, there will be an emphasis on nature in these suggestions and businesses that promote and practice environmentally friendly policies. 
Ultimately the app is not about discouraging travel. Instead it is about promoting environmentally friendly travel and a sustainable lifestyle. By translating the planned journey into tangible costs, in terms of time, money and impact on the environment, it is hoped that users will gain a deeper insight into their relationship with the environment and plan journeys in the most efficient way possible: timely, cheaply and cleanly. 

## Features

The app will harvest data provided by the Google Maps API in conjunction with user input to provide the user with information about how to reach their chosen destination in the cheapest and cleanest way possible within an appropriate timeframe. 
The user will select their location and choose a destination using the Google Maps API provided. The application will then take this data and provide the user with options that promote a balance between price, time and impact on the environment. This information will be represented just below the map, with one section for each of these considerations. 
The sections will display various options, with information on how long each option will take, how the user will reach their destination and also what the impact of the journey will be on the environment.  

Below this section will be a recommendation section. This section will detail the journey’s carbon footprint based on calculations using JavaScript and determine how the user can reach their destination with the smallest footprint possible based on available data. It will also inform the user how she may compensate for whatever negative impact the journey will have on the environment. For example, the user will have to plant X amount of trees and flying Y miles on a plane. 

The final section will provide details on accommodation, places to eat and tourist attractions. As mentioned above, there will be an emphasis on nature in these suggestions and businesses that promote and practice environmentally friendly policies. 


## Design

The user will be greeted by a welcome image that includes the app name. 

Following this, an introductory section will set out some basic information about the goal of the app - to promote environmentally friendly travel. There will also be some basic guidance about how to use the app. 

This section will be followed by another section containing the Google Maps API allowing users to select their destination. Based on the input provided by the user, the information will be provided under three sections below the map: cost, time and environmental impact, that will set out the costs incurred by the journey. Each of these sections will be contained in accordion-styled div containers on mobile to manage the information provided to the user in a clean and organised manner.
